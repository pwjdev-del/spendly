# Competitive & Gap Analysis Framework

Use this framework to deconstruct competitors and identify where you can win.

## Part 1: Competitive Landscape Audit
Select 5-10 direct competitors. For *each*, complete this dossier:

### Competitor Dossier Template
- **Name/URL**:
- **Core Value Prop**: (One sentence pitch)
- **Superpowers**: (What do they do exceptionally well?)
- **Kryptonite**: (What do users hate? check G2/Reddit/AppStore)
- **Monetization**: (Freemium, Ad-supported, Usage-based?)
- **Tech Stack**: (React, Flutter, Serverless?) *Use Wappalyzer to check.*
- **Brand Vibe**: (Corporate, Playful, Minimalist?)

## Part 2: The Gap Analysis Matrix
Categorize gaps to find your "Blue Ocean".

| Gap Type | Description | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feature Gap** | "They have Dark Mode, we don't." | **High** (if table stakes) |
| **Experience Gap** | "Their onboarding takes 10s, ours takes 2m." | **Critical** |
| **Performance Gap**| "Their dashboard loads in 200ms." | **High** |
| **Market Gap** | "They ignore enterprise users." | **Strategic Opportunity** |
| **Trust Gap** | "Users don't trust their data handling." | **Marketing Angle** |

### Priority Ranking
1.  **Critical**: User churns without this (Table Stakes).
2.  **Strategic**: The reason a user switches to us (Differentiator).
3.  **Nice-to-Have**: delight features, but not dealbreakers.
