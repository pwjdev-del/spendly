# Market Analysis & Opportunity Identification

How to build what the market actually needs, using backend data and research.

## 1. Identifying Market Gaps

### The "Feature Gap" Analysis
- **Competitor Auditing**: List top 3 competitors.
- **Matrix Mapping**: Create a feature matrix (Competitor A vs B vs Us).
- **The "Unserved" Search**: Look for features unmarked in *all* columns.
    - *Is it unserved because it's hard?* -> **Opportunity**.
    - *Is it unserved because nobody wants it?* -> **Risk**.

### User Feedback Mining
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Scrape Reddit, G2, App Store reviews.
- **Keyword Clustering**: Identify recurring pain points (e.g., "slow", "complicated", "expensive", "integrations").
- **Agentic Analysis**: Use LLMs to summarize thousands of user reviews into "Top 3 Feature Requests".

## 2. Competitive Landscape Methodologies

### SWOT Analysis (Modernized)
- **Strengths**: What technical moat do we have? (e.g., proprietary data, faster algorithm).
- **Weaknesses**: Tech debt, lack of features.
- **Opportunities**: Emerging regulations, new AI capabilities, API economy.
- **Threats**: AI commoditization, platform dependency.

### "Jobs to be Done" (JTBD)
- Don't focus on demographics. Focus on the *task*.
- **Framework**: "When [Situation], I want to [Motivation], so that I can [Outcome]."
- Backend implication: Optimize the *Outcome* latency and reliability.

## 3. Product-Led Growth (PLG) Metrics
- **Time to Value (TTV)**: How fast does the backend deliver the "Aha!" moment?
- **Virality K-Factor**: Are users inviting other users? (Backend: Invite systems, multi-player sync).
